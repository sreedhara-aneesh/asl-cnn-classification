# Convolutional Neural Networks for ASL Image Classification

## Overview

We aim to create and train a classifier to properly identify the sign language symbol that is present in an image input with the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Images depicting symbols within the American Sign Language will be utilized to train, validate, and test various convolutional neural networks with varying layer depths and activation functions to verify the impact of such variations on the performance of a model, primarily evaluated by the modelâ€™s accuracy.
